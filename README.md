Several robotics platforms are being developed specifically for use with the RobotMoose Web Robotics System. This repository stores files related to the hardware developed for these systems.
* The **layla**, **quizbot**, and **roomba** folders contain firmware and 3d models of parts and assemblies for those respective systems.
* The **sensors** folder contains files for subsystems being developed to expand the functionality of our robotics platforms.
