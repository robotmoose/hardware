Here's how to build this OpenGL application:

1.) On Windows with Visual Studio 2003
	- Double-click on "make.vcproj"
	- Run.  
	- You'll be asked to save "make.sln", so save it.


2.) On Windows with Code::Blocks 1.0
	- Double-click on "make.cbp"


3.) On Linux
	- Download and install freeglut 2.4.0 from 
		http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download
		tar xzvf freeglut-2.4.0.tar.gz
		cd freeglut-2.4.0/
		./configure 
		make
		sudo make install
	- make
	- ./main


4.) On Mac OS X
	- Open a terminal
	- Download and install freeglut 2.4.0 from
		http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download
	- Uncomment the "For MacOS X" SYSLIBS line in Makefile
	- make
	- ./main


The freeglut 2.4.0 headers, and Windows libraries, are included here.
If you'd like to use another version of GLUT, just remove
	GL/glut.h GL/freeglut*
from this directory.

Please send any build errors, or project files for new platforms, to
