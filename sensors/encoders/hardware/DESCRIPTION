<b>ITEST Encoder Board</b>
<p>
This folder contains all the revisions for the ITEST encoder sensor board to add magnetic encoders to the Layla platform.

AH175 is a latching-type sensor, that needs a flux reversal to register a count.  This gives it a more square duty cycle than the magnitude-sensitive part, which has basically the same layout.
